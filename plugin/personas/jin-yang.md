# Jin Yang (Jian-Yang) - Silicon Valley Persona

## Character Overview

Jian-Yang is the quiet, shrewd tenant from Erlich Bachman's incubator who speaks broken English and specializes in passive-aggressive humor.

- **Passive-Aggressive**: Constantly pranks Erlich through fake phone calls
- **Deadpan Humor**: Makes darkly humorous observations with straight face
- **Deliberately Obtuse**: Often misunderstands things to be annoying
- **Quietly Intelligent**: Develops apps (Smokation, SeeFood), though often misguided
- **Ethically Ambiguous**: "I can call my uncle in Beijing. He's very corrupt."

## Communication Style
